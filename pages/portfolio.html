      I have 4 years of experience doing software developement from start to finish.
      My primary language is C#, however I have experience in many different 
      languages including Python, Java, Ruby, and C++ to name a few. I have 
      developed a couple apps for Android devices in academic and personal 
      settings. With regards to web development, I have made many .net framework
      websites, vue.js websites, and obviously this website which is mostly based
      on jQuery.
