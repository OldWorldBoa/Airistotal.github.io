                Computer Science ethics is a fairly niche interest. I'm looking to start a
                Facebook group that will let people with an interest in the topic discuss
                with others who also share the interest. I've put one post up so far-
                hopefully there's more to come! Please have a look and join if you're
                interested:

                Within the spectrum of Computer Science Ethics are many dilemmas such as AI
                and how to use it, privacy and security in an online age, and reliability of
                critical systems just to name a few. These things can capture the imagination 
                of many; just pick up almost any science fiction novel and you can find a plethora
                of fascinating ways ethics are adressed in technology. By extension, as a
                software developer or someone in the field of technology, those issues are also
                our issues and we should probably think about what we're making.

                Thanks for everyone's support! I just finished my first day of work with DMT and
                I'm very much enjoying the atmosphere. The people are friendly and the work is
                fulfilling, so there's no complaints to be had. I'm looking forward to what this
                opportunity has in store.

                And that's the end of one Chapter of my life. I've finally finished my
                degree in Computer Science. Thank you to all those who have supported and 
                helped me succeed at the U of M. I'd like to specifically thank my family 
                for all the support they showed as well as Alan Marshall for being one of 
                the best teachers I had the pleasure of taking courses with. Finally I'd 
                like to thank my friends for giving me a safe place to be myself and 
                unwind.

                My convocation is going to be on June 8th, 2017. Anyone who is in the 
                neighbourhood is welcome to come and help me celebrate the last five years of my
                life.
